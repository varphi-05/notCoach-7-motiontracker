Start main.py to begin motion tracking. Instructions will be given in the python shell / cmd

The end result will be saved as an .csv file to this directory.

if you want to quit tracking in the process, press 'q'
(Note: this does not save the data acquired up to that point)

make sure numpy and opencv are both installed
